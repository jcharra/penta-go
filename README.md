# penta-go

Implementation of the tiny, but surprisingly complex game Pentago (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentago).

## Installation

Of course you need to have [Go](https://golang.org/) installed.

Then you have to call the following command (you might need to execute it*twice*, I haven't found out why).

```
go get github.com/jcharra/penta-go
```

Then try to run it with

```
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/jcharra/penta-go
go run penta.go
```
